Rocks Layer: http://services7.arcgis.com/yUlpDmY4xMAdbBIp/arcgis/rest/services/ParksRocks/FeatureServer

Web Map Application: http://savannanagorski.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=0a3b54d1ea8e4aaf83e82371dc0299de

From the application, you cannot edit. You would need to create an application (webapp builder from the Map details page) and add the functions I've added. 
There is a query tab to query posts *after* a certain date as well.

If I'm not here tomorrow, please call me at (253) 320-1521 or email srn0629@gmail.com if you have questions and I'll do my best to assist.
